As of now, this repo is purely an academic self-education exercise. No LICENSE should be inferred from any of this. I will inquire of Yamaoka what LICENSE he would prefer, if any. (Note also that Yamaoka might not want his name attached to any of this! I did make some modifications but they were minor "quality of life" changes, and un-hard-coding things like # of classes, layer dimensions, adding tqdm and wandb, etc.)
